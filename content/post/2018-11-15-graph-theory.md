Although my semester finishes rather earlier than my schoolmates this time, I still find myself a part-time job helping frosh year students review their test contents. Seriously speaking, after years of hiding myself behind statistical/mathematical programming languages, it is somehow a werid but refreshing experience to do the integration tricks, inverse a matrix and even seek for an isomorphism between graphs on paper.

Reading slides about graph theory is really a sense of deja vu to me. I took [Professor Nabutovsky](http://www.math.toronto.edu/alex/)'s intro to graph theory course back when I was at U of T. I might not remember all the materials taught in that one now, but I am still keeping a complete copy of review notes today. Every time I look at these notes, I would definitely recall the old days powering through the textbook _Graph Theory_ by _Reinhard Diestel_ (thought not all chapters are covered).

And I was too scared to use `$\LaTeX$` at that time, you could tell that I had to use markdown to insert a textbook screenshot there.

Here's my [Star-Wars-themed graph theory notes](/pdf/covered.pdf). Really, time flies.
