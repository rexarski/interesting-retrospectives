Two common misunderstanding for longtime `blogdown` lurkers (like me) or R markdown newbies:

1. Blogging with `blogdown` $\equiv$ writing reports with `knitr`. There is no need to "knit" every post you write, no matter which format (`.md` or `.Rmd`) you are using, since `blogdown` will handle them itself.

2. Deploying HTML inside a R markdown file can make the blog post more expressive than merely using Rmd syntax.

I didn't realize the second one until when I was browsing Nan Xiao's [blog](https://nanx.me/blog/), who is the author of this theme I'm using. At one point, I was wondering why his post looks so different from mine. Out of curiosity, I digged a little into his raw files and came up with these following "hacks".

### Insert an image with style

This has nothing to do with direct usage of HTML, but still is different from traditional markdown rendering. R markdown will not render the name/caption of an image automatically, but it's not the same case in `blogdown` here.

I used to like inserting an image with placeholder name like `img`, so the R markdown codes would look like this:

```
![img](path-to-this-image)
```

Somehow if this is the case, `blogdown` will render the image without any problem but leave you a weird image caption "img".

**Solution:** Either you ignore the `img` with a pair of blank square brackets,

```
![](path-to-this-image)
```
or you figure out a nice caption for the image and do the rest like before. And you can even insert a hyperlink inside the caption. For example:

```
![This is a [logo](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png) of R project.](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)
```

![This is a [logo](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png) of R project.](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)

### Embed a YouTube video

<strike>Here's something R markdown cannot do. We need to borrow the power from HTML.</strike>.

**Update:** According to this post "[Use shortcodes to embed tweets, videos, etc. in your blogdown blog posts ](http://www.reigo.eu/2018/04/shortcodes/)", one line code can solve the problem:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "jKp-WuK6iv8")
```

<p class="caption">"How could this happen?"</p>

<p></p>

Note that in the code blog, we need to flag the argument `eval=TRUE`.

Additionally, I guess one line of HTML as caption `<p class="caption">"How could this happen?"</p>` will increase the "stylelishness" of an embedded media by all means.

```html
<p class="caption">"How could this happen?"</p>
```

### Pre-formatted table

R markdown tables look nice most of the time. But sometimes we need more. With html tag `<pre></pre>`, one can easily display a pre-formatted table.

```html
<pre><output>
item1   item2   item3   item4
=============================
Gou     Li      Guo     Jia
-----------------------------
Qi      Yin     Huo     Fu
=============================
run_time: 59.0s
total_time: 60.0s
</output></pre>
```

<pre><output>
item1   item2   item3   item4
=============================
Gou     Li      Guo     Jia
-----------------------------
Qi      Yin     Huo     Fu
=============================
run_time: 59.0s
total_time: 60.0s
</output></pre>

A real example of [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG).

### Code display

One way to do so is, of course, to write in a code block. Alternatively, we can attach an external link like this:

```html
<script src="https://gist.github.com/rexarski/92e120c3ffad70877716d99f6bfd66a3.js"></script>
```

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rexarski/92e120c3ffad70877716d99f6bfd66a3.js"></script>
<p class="caption">"Read Markdown table into R data frame."</p>

There is also a convenient button to generate this html script in GitHub.

### And finally this ...

I thought the shadow under some inserted images come from some extra HTML scripts. The fact is that it's a native feature in macOS.

- **Command + Shift + 4:** Take a screen shot with area selection, traditionally.
- **Command + Shift + 5:** Bring out the screenshot tool bar. If a screenshot is taken to capture the selected window, it will generate some shadow below.
