- Create key pairs in the EC2 tab of AWS console.
- Download the private key as `.pem` file. **This is your only chance!**
- Use `sudo ssh-keygen -y -f that-private-key.pem` to generate a public key.
- Copy and paste the public key, which should be in the form of `ssh-rsa **********` to path `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` of your remote server.
- Tada! Now you can use `sudo ssh -i that-private-key.pem ec2user@ec2ip` to access your remote from your local machine.
