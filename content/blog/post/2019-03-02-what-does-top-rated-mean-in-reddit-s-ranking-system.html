<p>Though Reddit’s comment sorting system has been in use for almost a decade, the fact is that I wasn’t so exposed to western internet community till 2013, it is still, a rather new thing to me.</p>
<p>Randall, the author of <a href="https://xkcd.com">xkcd</a>, also my favourite internet comics, wrote a blog<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> explaining what the algorithm is. Meanwhile, a detailed version is introduced by Evan Miller<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the latter, Evan gave two examples of two “wrong” ranking methods:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Score = positive - negative;</li>
<li>Score = positive / total.</li>
</ol>
<p>To say they are “wrong”, does not mean that they are not possible to give a rough idea in all scenarios. But the reality is always complex, a rough idea is probably a synonym of “meaninglessness”. To be specific, the first case ignore the “ratio” part in the term of “highest rated”, that means a more controversial comment might exceed a quality post simply due to more people voting on it. The second case, however, ignores the scenario where the sample space is limited. For instance, we can hardly say that a 1 of 1 upvoted comment is better than that of 99 of 100 upvoted comment.</p>
<p>How Reddit deals with this problem is trying to reach a confident balance between positive proportion and small number of observations. Now suppose the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each voting event is independent.</li>
<li>Each event can either be a positive or a negative.</li>
<li>The total number of votes is <code>$ n $</code>, the number of positive votes is <code>$ k $</code>, <code>$ \hat{p}=k/n $</code> is the positive proportion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the idea is to first find each <code>$ \hat{p} $</code>, then calculate the corresponding confidence intervals, and finally rank the items by their lower bounds of confidence intervals.</p>
<p>The perfect expression of these confidence intervals here is:</p>
<div>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \left(\hat{p}+\frac{z^2_{\alpha/2}}{2n} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{[\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})+z^2_{\alpha/2}/4n]/n}\right)/(1+z^2_{\alpha/2}/n) \]</span></p>
</div>
<p>In 1928, mathematician Edwin Bidwell Wilson<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> developed this score interval above to estimate the successful (or positive, in our case) probability <code>$ \hat{p} $</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s my R script to simulate a comment ranking situation possibly happening every day on Reddit.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)

Wilson &lt;- function(n, k, alpha=0.95) {
    phat &lt;- k/n
    score &lt;- qnorm(1-(1-alpha)/2)
    lbound &lt;- (phat+score**2/(2*n)-score*sqrt((phat*(1-phat)+score**2/(4*n))/n))/(1+score**2/n)
    return(lbound)
}

seed(2019)
x &lt;- sample(1:500,200,replace=T)
y &lt;- sample(1:500,200,replace=T)

votes &lt;- data.frame(x,y)
votes %&gt;%
    rowwise() %&gt;%
    mutate(pos=min(x,y),total=max(x,y)) %&gt;%
    select(total, pos) %&gt;%
    mutate(Wilson=Wilson(total,pos)) %&gt;%
    arrange(desc(Wilson))</code></pre>
<p>And the pseudo-results are:</p>
<pre><code># A tibble: 200 x 3
   total   pos Wilson
   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;
 1   473   467  0.973
 2   494   487  0.971
 3   390   385  0.970
 4   234   232  0.969
 5   354   347  0.960
 6   237   233  0.957
 7   123   121  0.943
 8   391   376  0.938
 9   296   285  0.935
10   415   397  0.932
# ... with 190 more rows</code></pre>
