Was inspired by an Hearthstone cardback artwork featuring avocado and egg, so I decided to make a new dish with my newly purchased air fryer.

**Steps:**

1. Cut the avocado into halves.
2. Remove the seed.
3. Crack an egg and pour it onto the avo.
4. Spray some salt, pepper and spices.
5. Pre-heat the air fryer at 200 Celsius degree for 5 minutes.
6. Fry the avo at 180 Celsius degree for 8 minutes.

Enjoy!
