On Windows, we have a package called [`installr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/installr/index.html). Use function `copy.packages.between.libraries()`, then problem solved.

On macOS, unfortunately, we don’t have that handy tool.

But we can still use the following to retrieve all current installed packages’ names:

```r
to_install <- as.vector(installed.packages()[,1])
install.packages(to_install)
```

A more concrete [solution](https://www.r-bloggers.com/quick-way-of-installing-all-your-old-r-libraries-on-a-new-device/) would be only updating those non-base-R packages:

```r
installed <- as.data.frame(installed.packages())
write.csv(installed, 'installed_previously.csv')

installedPreviously <- read.csv('installed_previously.csv')
baseR <- as.data.frame(installed.packages())
toInstall <- setdiff(installedPreviously, baseR)

install.packages(toInstall)
```

Still, I wish those old packages can be transfered to a new version of R painlessly.
