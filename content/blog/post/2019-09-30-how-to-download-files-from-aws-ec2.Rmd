<strike>SCP</strike> `scp` is always our friend.

```bash
scp -i /path/to/permission/file username@ec2.url:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory
```

**Update on 2019-10-14.** *What if I need to copy files that need root access?*

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/permission/file username@ec2.url "sudo cat /var/log/nginx/access.log" > ~/Downloads/access.log
```

Generally, if it is a log that could be printed out. Just print and save it to local.
