<p><em>Interesting retrospective</em> is a naïve blog still under construction.</p>
<p>Its previous name was <em>Quickshot</em>, which originated from an infamous (for a while) <a href="https://hearthstone.huijiwiki.com/wiki/%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%B0%84%E5%87%BB"><em>Hearthstone</em> Hunter spell</a>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I’ve tried numerous static site generators and platforms to construct a personal blog. They are quite different and I won’t do the comparison here. (In fact, somebody <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">did</a>.) One thing that I can conclude from my previous experiences is that I fail to write stuffs in a long term. It’s just not a habit of mine.</p>
<p>People always ask themselves by the end of a year, <em>What have I accomplished this year?</em> I do too. But my answer never includes <strong>blogging for a whole year</strong>. Hopefully, I may have a updated version of this answer by the end of next year.</p>
