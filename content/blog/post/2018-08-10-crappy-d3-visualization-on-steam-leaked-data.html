<p>Ever since <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1667896941884942467">Valve updated their privacy policy on Steam</a>, third party tools like <a href="https://steamspy.com/">SteamSpy</a> would not be able to scrape gaming data from users. It seems that the myth of <em>how many games are there now</em> might stay in the fog forever.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://medium.com/@tglaiel/using-achievement-stats-to-estimate-sales-on-steam-d18b4b635d23">Tyler Glaiel</a> on Medium came out with a method to estiamte the Steam game user numbers by analyzing the games’ achievements. In this method, a csv file of a total number of 13281 games was generated.</p>
<p>Soon, Mike Bostock, the creator of D3.js posted a visualization of this dataset in the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8ww7c2/leaked_estimates_of_steam_player_counts_oc/">r/dataisbeautiful</a>.</p>

<p>Inspired by his work, and also his previous implementation in D3 gallery, I also sketched a crappy version of this dataset.</p>

<p><strike>I’ll just leave it here. </strike> Unfortunately, I haven’t figured out how to insert a live version of d3 to a webpage.</p>
