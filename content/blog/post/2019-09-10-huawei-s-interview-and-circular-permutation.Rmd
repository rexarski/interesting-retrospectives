A colleague had a coding interview for Huawei last Sunday. I heard the second question was quite “mathematical”.  Let me rephrase it here a little bit.

> A hero summoner in a MOBA game has an ability to manipulate three elements. By controlling the order of releasing these elements, he can cast different spells accordingly. For example, casting in the order of *fire, water, lightening* can be treated as a spell. But there are some limitations as well.
> Consider fitting the elements of that spell in a cycle. Then turning the cycle clockwise or counterclockwise does not produce any new spells.  Additionally, inverting the cycle will not generate new ones either. The question is, if n is the number of elements he is capable of mastering, m is the number of elements consisting a spell, then what is the value of the number of different spells modulo 1000000007?

Typically, the mathematical term that describes the way of ordering elements, is called  [Circular Permutation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularPermutation.html).

The number of ways to arrange $n$ distinct objects along a fixed (i.e., cannot be picked up out of the plane and turned over) circle is

$$P_n=(n-1)!$$.

The reason why it is the factorial of $n-1$ instead of $n$ is all cycle rotation.

If we consider a stricter definition, there will be only three free permutations (i.e., inequivalent when flipping the circle is allowed).

$$P’_n=\frac{1}{2} (n-1)!, n\geq 3$$

In our problem, the number would be

$${n \choose m} \frac{1}{2} (m-1)!$$

Since $1\leq m \leq 10000, 1\leq n \leq 20000$, direct calculation of factorial is suicidal for a computer. The hack here should be using modulo arithmetic, namely, we only keep the mod of $10^9 + 7$ in intermediate steps.

```r
fact <- function(n) {
  res <- 1
  for (i in 1:n) {
    res <- (res * i) %% 1000000007
  }
  return(res)
}
```

Although `factorial(203)` will give us `Inf` as a result, `fact(203` won’t. It will give us an exact answer of `572421883`.
