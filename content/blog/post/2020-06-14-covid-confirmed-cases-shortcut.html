<p>This post is a subsequent blog to my daily experience basically in the last two months. As the general situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australian Capital Territory keeps is keeping stable, sometimes I almost forget to check on this Shortcut.</p>
<p>Long story short, general idea is if you have very specific information in need, you can always create a temporary iOS Shortcut to assist you in capturing such information. In my case, it is the number of confirmed cases in ACT. Very specific. Therefore, all I need to do is to go to the government’s website, find the page containing that value, and scrape it in HTML. And BOOM, you get it out of there.</p>
<p>I’ll specify the steps in the context of Shortcut:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create an action called “URL”. Insert the value as <code>https://www.health.act.gov.au/about-our-health-system/novel-coronavirus-covid-19</code>.</li>
<li>Create an action called “Get Contents of URL” with method <code>GET</code>.</li>
<li>Create an action called “Make rich text from HTML”. Replace <code>HTML</code> with <code>Contents of URL</code>.</li>
<li>Create an action called “Match Text”. Replace the two placeholders with <code>(Confirmed cases \d+)</code> and <code>Rich Text from HTML</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Create one last action called “Show results”. And change the last variable to <code>Matches</code>.</li>
</ol>
