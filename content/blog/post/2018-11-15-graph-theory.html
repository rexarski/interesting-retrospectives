<p>Although my semester finishes rather earlier than my schoolmates this time, I still find myself a part-time job helping frosh year students review their test contents. Seriously speaking, after years of hiding myself behind statistical/mathematical programming languages, it is somehow a werid but refreshing experience to do the integration tricks, inverse a matrix and even seek for an isomorphism between graphs on paper.</p>
<p>Reading slides about graph theory is really a sense of deja vu to me. I took <a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/alex/">Professor Nabutovsky</a>’s intro to graph theory course back when I was at U of T. I might not remember all the materials taught in that one now, but I am still keeping a complete copy of review notes today. Every time I look at these notes, I would definitely recall the old days powering through the textbook <em>Graph Theory</em> by <em>Reinhard Diestel</em> (thought not all chapters are covered).</p>
<p>And I was too scared to use <code>$\LaTeX$</code> at that time, you could tell that I had to use markdown to insert a textbook screenshot there.</p>
<p>Here’s my <a href="/pdf/graph-theory.pdf">Star-Wars-themed graph theory notes</a>. Really, time flies.</p>
