<p>So today marks the release date of the latest Hearthstone expansion <strike>Dr. Boom’s Project</strike> <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/the-boomsday-project">The Boomsday Project</a>. As usual, I’ve done some pack opening with my pal. But this time, I’ve also taken down some data and made a simple scatterplot (maybe?) just for fun.</p>

<div id="some-results" class="section level2">
<h2>Some results:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I was probably too sleepy at 3 am in the morning, lost 2 packs’ data. The total pack number should be 120 instead of 118.</li>
<li>Including the guaranteed one in the first 10 packs, I discovered 9 legendary cards in total. But unfortunately, none of them is golden. The first 8 legendary cards were opened in the first 60 packs. Pretty imbalanced!</li>
<li>The most common card combination is, of course, 4 commons + 1 rare (Let’s call it “4c1r”). Out of all my 118 packs, 66 of them are of this type, which take about 56% of total pack opening. (Blizzard you are too greedy!)</li>
<li>The longest streak of 4c1r is 6.</li>
</ul>
<p>This post might not have any actual meaning. But I’m generally happy with the results since at least I’ve got the leading role of this expansion: <em>Dr. Boom</em>.</p>
