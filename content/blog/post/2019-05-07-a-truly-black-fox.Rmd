As a Firefox user at night, I find [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) and [Shadowfox](https://overdodactyl.github.io/ShadowFox/) real MVPs of the game.

The former is pretty smart at turning websites into dark mode after dynamically analyzing the web-site colors and background images. You can also use shortcut like Option/Alt⌥ + Shift⇧ + D to toggle the extension.

The latter does what Firefox should have included in its so-called dark mode: global dark mode. In this way, the user interface and other "protected" web pages will also be darkened.

Why dark mode? Here are two articles talking about the reasons behind:

- [The Benefits of Dark Mode](https://www.keepproductive.com/blog/benefits-of-dark-mode)
- [Reddit: Why do people want dark mode so badly?](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4odg6w/why_do_people_want_dark_mode_so_badly/)

I love the top comment in that reddit post:

    Night is dark. Screen is bright. Eyes hurt.
