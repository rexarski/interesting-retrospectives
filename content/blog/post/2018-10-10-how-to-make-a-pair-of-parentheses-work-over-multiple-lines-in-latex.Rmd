Gotta say this is a really handy trick.

```latex
\[
    \begin{split}
        a &= \left( \frac12 + \frac13 + \frac14 \right.\\
          &\ \ \ \ \ \ \quad \left. {} + a + b + c \vphatom{\frac12}\right)\\
          &= x + y + z
    \end{split}
\]
```

The key idea is to use `\vphatom{\frac12}`, which is of the same height of previous line, to force the right parenthesis in the second line to match with its counterpart.
