<p>A colleague had a coding interview for Huawei last Sunday. I heard the second question was quite “mathematical”. Let me rephrase it here a little bit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A hero summoner in a MOBA game has an ability to manipulate three elements. By controlling the order of releasing these elements, he can cast different spells accordingly. For example, casting in the order of <em>fire, water, lightening</em> can be treated as a spell. But there are some limitations as well.
Consider fitting the elements of that spell in a cycle. Then turning the cycle clockwise or counterclockwise does not produce any new spells. Additionally, inverting the cycle will not generate new ones either. The question is, if n is the number of elements he is capable of mastering, m is the number of elements consisting a spell, then what is the value of the number of different spells modulo 1000000007?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, the mathematical term that describes the way of ordering elements, is called <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CircularPermutation.html">Circular Permutation</a>.</p>
<p>The number of ways to arrange <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct objects along a fixed (i.e., cannot be picked up out of the plane and turned over) circle is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_n=(n-1)!\]</span>.</p>
<p>The reason why it is the factorial of <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is all cycle rotation.</p>
<p><img class="special-img-class" style="width:100%" src="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CircularPermutations_950.gif" /></p>
<p>If we consider a stricter definition, there will be only three free permutations (i.e., inequivalent when flipping the circle is allowed).</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P’_n=\frac{1}{2} (n-1)!, n\geq 3\]</span></p>
<p>In our problem, the number would be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[{n \choose m} \frac{1}{2} (m-1)!\]</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(1\leq m \leq 10000, 1\leq n \leq 20000\)</span>, direct calculation of factorial is suicidal for a computer. The hack here should be using modulo arithmetic, namely, we only keep the mod of <span class="math inline">\(10^9 + 7\)</span> in intermediate steps.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fact &lt;- function(n) {
  res &lt;- 1
  for (i in 1:n) {
    res &lt;- (res * i) %% 1000000007
  }
  return(res)
}</code></pre>
<p>Although <code>factorial(203)</code> will give us <code>Inf</code> as a result, <code>fact(203</code> won’t. It will give us an exact answer of <code>572421883</code>.</p>
