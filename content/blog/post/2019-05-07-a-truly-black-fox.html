<p>As a Firefox user at night, I find <a href="https://darkreader.org/">Dark Reader</a> and <a href="https://overdodactyl.github.io/ShadowFox/">Shadowfox</a> real MVPs of the game.</p>
<p>The former is pretty smart at turning websites into dark mode after dynamically analyzing the web-site colors and background images. You can also use shortcut like Option/Alt⌥ + Shift⇧ + D to toggle the extension.</p>

<p>The latter does what Firefox should have included in its so-called dark mode: global dark mode. In this way, the user interface and other “protected” web pages will also be darkened.</p>
<p>Why dark mode? Here are two articles talking about the reasons behind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.keepproductive.com/blog/benefits-of-dark-mode">The Benefits of Dark Mode</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4odg6w/why_do_people_want_dark_mode_so_badly/">Reddit: Why do people want dark mode so badly?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I love the top comment in that reddit post:</p>
<pre><code>Night is dark. Screen is bright. Eyes hurt.
