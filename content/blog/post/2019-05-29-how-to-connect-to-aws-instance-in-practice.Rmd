1. When creating an instance in AWS, make sure you download the key pair as a `.pem` file. Otherwise, if you are like me, I got the private key from my colleague. It reads as:

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
SOMETHINGLIKETHISHERE…
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

2. Copy and paste from wherever you get it, save as a `.pem` file, e.g. `aws-key.pem`.

3. While looking for solutions online, I found a quite useful suggestion to create a specific directory called `.pem` under your root directory in order to save all your certificates. So it’s kind of optional to do:

```bash
mkdir .pem
# then cd to the directory of aws-key.pem
mv aws-key.pem ~/.pem
cd ~/.pem
```

4.  `chmod 400 aws-key.pem`

5.  Find and copy the Public DNS of your instance in the AWS console and

```bash
ssh -i ~/.pem/aws-key.pem root@insert-your-public-dns-here.com
```

6. Lastly, you might get a prompt telling you that you should login as the user “centos” rather than “root”, under the circumstance that you are playing around with CentOS.

7. Jobs done.
