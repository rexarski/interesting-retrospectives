_Interesting retrospective_ is a na√Øve blog still under construction.

Its previous name was _Quickshot_, which originated from an infamous (for a while) [_Hearthstone_ Hunter spell](https://hearthstone.huijiwiki.com/wiki/%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%B0%84%E5%87%BB).

![*Han shot first.*](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/9/9c/Quick_Shot%2814459%29_Gold.png?version=e4cd3e0289f02134f366e4a9569dd3f1)

Honestly, I've tried numerous static site generators and platforms to construct a personal blog. They are quite different and I won't do the comparison here. (In fact, somebody [did](https://www.staticgen.com/).) One thing that I can conclude from my previous experiences is that I fail to write stuffs in a long term. It's just not a habit of mine.

People always ask themselves by the end of a year, _What have I accomplished this year?_ I do too. But my answer never includes **blogging for a whole year**. Hopefully, I may have a updated version of this answer by the end of next year.
