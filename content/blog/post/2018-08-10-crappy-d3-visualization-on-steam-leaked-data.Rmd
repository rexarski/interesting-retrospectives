Ever since [Valve updated their privacy policy on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1667896941884942467), third party tools like [SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com/) would not be able to scrape gaming data from users. It seems that the myth of _how many games are there now_ might stay in the fog forever.

However, [Tyler Glaiel](https://medium.com/@tglaiel/using-achievement-stats-to-estimate-sales-on-steam-d18b4b635d23) on Medium came out with a method to estiamte the Steam game user numbers by analyzing the games' achievements. In this method, a csv file of a total number of 13281 games was generated.

Soon, Mike Bostock, the creator of D3.js posted a visualization of this dataset in the subreddit [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8ww7c2/leaked_estimates_of_steam_player_counts_oc/).

Inspired by his work, and also his previous implementation in D3 gallery, I also sketched a crappy version of this dataset.

<strike>I'll just leave it here. </strike> Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to insert a live version of d3 to a webpage.
