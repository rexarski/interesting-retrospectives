After reading the book *[Learn Git the Hard Way](https://leanpub.com/learngitthehardway)*, I’m still a little bit confused about:

- `git rebase`
- `git cherry-pick`

The book is quite practical, but the pdf version misses lots of figures in the original e-book (on Leanpub.com).

So I turn to *[The Documentation](https://git-scm.com/)* for help.

## Rebase
To summarize, what `git rebase` can do are:

### To combine multiple commits into “one”
![](/image/rebase1.png)

The command format is

```git
git rebase -i [startpoint] [endpoint]
```

The tag `-i` stands for `—interactive`. Follow the instructions.

### To paste a collection of commits to another branch
![](/image/rebase2.png)

```git
git rebase [startpoint] [endpoint] --onto [branchname]
```

After that, just don’t forget the `HEAD` is detached at this moment, like this:
![](/image/rebase3.png)

So, a proper follow-up is:

```git
git checkout master
git reset --hard [endpoint]	# the id will be prompted after the previous command
```

## Cherry-pick
A better solution to `rebase`’s second functionality?

```git
git branch acorrectbranch
# in a correct branch, use this
git cherry-pick [commit id]
```

- If any conflict happens, resolve the conflicts, add files if needed. `git cherry-pick —continue`
- `git cherry-pick --abort` to abort the process.
