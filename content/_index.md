Greetings, traveler! ðŸ¤ 

My name is RuÃ¬. I currently work as a project manager at a small startup located in Canberra, Australia. Most of my time I work remotely with my teammates to build an educational platform for our client.

I'm always into data visualization and caring about how to present data vividly and appropriately in traditional media.

I finished my master degree here in the Australian National University. Before that I was an undergraduate student majored in maths and stats at University of Toronto, Canada.

This blog basically serves as my learning notebook. Yes, people gotta keep on learning even after graduation. I will try to jot down any sparks in my mind, share my experiences after graduation and keep a record of anything cool I come across.

When I'm not at work, I am probably either experimenting new recipes in my kitchen or binge listening to podcasts.

Although I don't do book reviews, I still [keep track of my readings](https://www.douban.com/people/rexarski/). I'm also a casual Switch gamer and a unpaid [Football Manager](https://www.footballmanager.com/).
