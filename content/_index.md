_Interesting retrospective_ is a na√Øve blog still under construction.

Its previous name was _Quickshot_, which originated from an infamous _Hearthstone_ [Hunter spell](https://hearthstone.huijiwiki.com/wiki/%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%B0%84%E5%87%BB).

Honestly, I've tried numerous static site generators and platforms to construct a personal blog. They are quite different and I won't do the comparison here. (In fact, somebody [did](https://www.staticgen.com/).) One thing that I can conclude from my previous experiences is that I fail to write stuffs in a long term. It's just not a habit of mine.

People always ask themselves by the end of a year, _What have I accomplished this year?_ I do too. But my answer never includes **blogging for a whole year**. Hopefully, I may have a updated version of this answer by the end of next year.
