My name is Qiū Ruì (邱睿), currently located in Canberra, Australia. I work as a project manager at a local tech startup.

I'm always into data visualization and caring about how to present data vividly and appropriately in traditional media.

I finished my master degree here in the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/). Before that I was an undergraduate student majored in maths and stats at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), Canada.

This blog basically serves as my learning notebook. (Yes, gotta keep on learning even after graduation.) I will try to jot down any sparks in my mind, share my experiences after graduation and keep a record of anything cool I find.

(Please forgive me for any hilarious typo or grammatical error as English is my second language. Cheers.)
