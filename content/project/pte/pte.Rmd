# 题型介绍 (Read Aloud)

- For this item type you need to read a written text aloud.The recording status box displays a countdown until the microphone opens. You have **30-40 seconds to prepare,** depending on the length of the passage. You hear a short tone. After the tone, start speaking immediately. Do not start speaking before the microphone opens because your voice will not be recorded.
- You should speak **clearly**. There is **no need to rush**.
- Finish speaking before the progress bar reaches the end. The word “Recording” changes to “Completed”.
- You are only able to record your response once.
- TIP: **If you remain silent for longer than 3 seconds, the recording will stop**.

## 例题

> Moreover, even though we stick to the setting where the coefficient matrices are Hermitian and simultaneously diagonalizable, the main steps in the derivation, especially the construction of a “deterministic equivalent” of the resolvent of the symmetrized autocovariance matrix, is very general and can be applied to linear processes with structures that go beyond the settings studied in this paper, for example, when the simultaneous diagonalizability of the coefficient matrices is replaced by a form of simultaneous block diagonalizability, even though the latter is not pursued in this paper due to lack of clear statistical motivation.
